# What drives the price of a car?
Overview:
In this application, we explored a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. The goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of my analysis, I should provide clear recommendations to my client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

Data:
Used cars dataset.

Deliverables:
After understanding, preparing, and modeling my data, a basic report is attacned that details my primary findings. This will benefit used car dealers interested in fine-tuning their inventory.
