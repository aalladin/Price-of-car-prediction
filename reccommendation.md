Key Insights: The features that strongly influence used car prices are those that have the most significant values in our model. Basically, the bigger the value, the more impact it has on the price of a used car.

However, there's a bit of complexity when considering 'manufacturer' and 'model'. Since we've used a special method to convert these categories into numbers, the impact they have on price is tied to the average price of cars in each category. So, a change in these values actually reflects changes in these average prices.

Firstly, the age of a car plays a significant role in determining its price. As expected, newer cars tend to command higher prices in the used car market. Therefore, it might be beneficial to stock more recent models in your inventory, as they are likely to bring in higher profits.

Our analysis also revealed that the manufacturer and model of a car significantly impact the car's price. For example, premium brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW tend to have higher prices compared to other brands. It may be a good strategy to stock more cars from premium brands, as they could potentially bring higher returns.
